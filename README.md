## FDA-ARGOS Project
FDA-ARGOS database updates may help researchers rapidly validate diagnostic tests and use qualified genetic sequences to support future product development

As of September 2021, Embleema and George Washington University have been conducting bioinformatic research and system development, focusing on expanding the FDA-ARGOS database. This project expands datasets publicly available in FDA-ARGOS, improves quality control by developing quality matrix tools and scoring approaches that will allow the mining of public sequence databases, and identifies high-quality sequences for upload to the FDA-ARGOS database as regulatory-grade sequences. Building on expansions during the COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims to further improve the utility of the FDA-ARGOS database as a key tool for medical countermeasure development and validation.

The FDA-ARGOS Project GitHub Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/FDA-ARGOS/data.argosdb).

### Location
- Code files can be found in the [lib](https://github.com/FDA-ARGOS/data.argosdb/tree/main/lib) section of the FDA-ARGOS GitHub. 
- Most files created and edited by me can be found in the FDA-ARGOS [HIVE3](https://github.com/FDA-ARGOS/data.argosdb/tree/main/lib/HIVE3) folder.

## SlimNT
slimNT has been developed to provide a curated, streamlined version of the NT database. Metagenomic analysis can be difficult and time consuming when querying against the 368001 genomes in NT, and the necessary indexing step is resource heavy; both time and computationally. slimNT aims to ##solve## that problem by strategically sub setting the NT database to create a compact, user-defined database that is tailored to specific needs.

The repository can be found here: [slimNT Repository](https://github.com/GW-HIVE/slimNT)
All documentation files and code scripts under the [pipeline](https://github.com/GW-HIVE/slimNT/tree/main/pipeline) folder were updated and created by me.

## Master's Thesis
My thesis titled _Bridging Genomics and Preparedness: Quality Control Metrics and Analysis for Emerging and Circulating Avian Influenza in 2024-2025_ was completed and accepted in May 2025 for my Master's Program in Bioinformatics and Molecular Biochemistry.
All the data and code can be found in the folder titled [Thesis](https://github.com/cwoodside1278/Christie--HIVE-Lab/tree/main/Thesis).
