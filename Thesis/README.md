# Thesis Code
The code within this folder was utilized to create the datatables for my thesis paper. The data tables used the same schema as those found on data.argosdb.org. It created three tables:
- H5N1_assemblyQC
- H5N1_ngsQC
- H5N1_biosampleMeta

## Observable Figures
The code that was used to create the figures can be found on Observable. 
The most current renderings of the image can be [found here]().
