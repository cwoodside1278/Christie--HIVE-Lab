# ARGOS Data Counts

Shell scripts in this folder were used as house cleaning files to make sure the counts were correct. Most of the code script were used to verify counts used in the Argoa QC Paper for Table 1. The counst were also used to verify missing organisms that have not been run, and prgansisms without assembly accessions.
