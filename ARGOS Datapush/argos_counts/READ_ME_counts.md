# ARGOS Data Counts

Shell scripts in this folder were used as house cleaning files to make sure the datacounts were correct. 
Most of the code script were used to verify counts used in the Argos QC Paper for _Table 1_. The counts were also used to verify missing organisms that have not been run, and organsisms without assembly accessions.
