# README File for Christie Woodside
These code scripts are used to take the JSON putputs from HIVE3 instance and convert them into a tsv/table to be used in data.argosdb
The currently used scripts are:
- json2tsv-V2assemQC.py
- biosample_datagrabber_v3.py
- biosample_datagrabber_v2.py (when running an old JSON that does not have nested IDs)
- ngsQC_datatable.sh

All files can still be located in the ARGOS GitHub and updated frequently
